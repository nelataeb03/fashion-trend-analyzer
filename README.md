# Fashion Trend Analyzer

## Project Motive

As someone passionate about both fashion and technology, I created the Fashion Trend Analyzer to explore the intersection of these two fields. The goal is to analyze and track fashion trends using data from Pinterest, providing insights into the latest styles and preferences. This project combines my love for data science, software engineering, and fashion, demonstrating how technology can be leveraged to gain a deeper understanding of fashion trends.
